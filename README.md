# _Anagrams_

#### _An anagram and antigram checker, version 1.0_

#### By _**By Mitchell Long, Week 1 of Ruby**_

## Description

_This application takes two words from a user and tells the user if the words are an anagrams.  An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as cinema, formed from iceman.

The application makes this evaluation regardless of case, checks to see if the two words are palindromes, and makes sure that the words have a vowell.

If the phrases aren't anagrams the application will check to see if the words are antigrams. A word is an antigram of another word if  no letters match.  EX: "hi" and "bye"

The application supports multiple word entries for both anagrams and antigrams.
